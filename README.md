# The Hacker's Diet Diary

The Hacker's Diet Diary is a diary intended to be an easier alternative to LibreOffice 
Calc / Microsoft Excel sheets-based diet diaries.

## The Hacker's Diet

### What is it?

The [Hacker's Diet](https://www.fourmilab.ch/hackdiet/e4) is a method to lose weight
designed as an engineering project. The author does not sell anything, he provides a
method and a set of tools to measure and manage the weight loss. By measuring the
weight on a daily basis, these tools provide a trend, bullish or bearish, and the excess or
deficit of ingested calories. It only remains to adjust the meals.

### Does it works?

If you're patient enough and adjust your meals following the trend, it works. The best
description of the method is in the book, anyway. It worked for me.
